network.isReachable
===================

Checks if a connection can be established with a specific domain.

    network.isReachable(reachableHostname, reachableCallback, [reachableOptions])

Description
-----------

This is a fast way to determine the device's network connection state, type of connection, and whether a specific domain is online.

Since `network.isReachable` is an asynchronous function, the network state is returned using a callback function.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

- Android
- BlackBerry
- BlackBerry Widgets (OS 5.0 and higher)
- iPhone

Quick Example
-------------

    function reachableCallback(reachability) {
        // There is no consistency on the format of reachability
        var networkState = reachability.code || reachability;
        
        var states = {};
        states[NetworkStatus.NOT_REACHABLE]                      = 'No network connection';
        states[NetworkStatus.REACHABLE_VIA_CARRIER_DATA_NETWORK] = 'Carrier data connection';
        states[NetworkStatus.REACHABLE_VIA_WIFI_NETWORK]         = 'WiFi connection';
    
        alert('Connection type: ' + states[networkState]);
    }
    
    navigator.network.isReachable('phonegap.com', reachableCallback);
